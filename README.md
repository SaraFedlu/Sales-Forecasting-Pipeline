# **Rossmann Sales Forecasting**

This project aims to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to forecast sales for Rossmann stores across several cities. The primary goal is to predict sales six weeks ahead of time, leveraging historical sales data, store information, and external factors like promotions, holidays, and competition.

## **Project Objectives**
1. **Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior:**
   - Analyze how factors like promotions, holidays, seasonality, and competition affect sales.
   - Understand trends in customer purchasing patterns.
2. **Sales Prediction:**
   - Develop and evaluate models for forecasting sales using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
3. **Deployment:**
   - Serve predictions through a web interface for easy access by the finance team and analysts.

## **Datasets**
### **1. train.csv**
- Historical sales data for stores.
- Key columns:  
  - `Store`, `Sales`, `Customers`, `Promo`, `StateHoliday`, `SchoolHoliday`.

### **2. test.csv**
- Store data for future prediction.
- Key columns:  
  - `Store`, `Date`, `Promo`, `StateHoliday`, `SchoolHoliday`.

### **3. store.csv**
- Metadata for stores, including:
  - `StoreType`, `Assortment`, `CompetitionDistance`, `Promo2`.

### **4. sample_submission.csv**
- Format for submitting predictions.

## **Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior**
### **Key Insights:**
1. **Promotions:**
   - Stores with active promotions (`Promo=1`) show nearly **81% higher sales** compared to days without promotions.
2. **Holidays:**
   - Sales drop significantly during holidays, except for Christmas and certain high-season periods like December.
3. **Assortment:**
   - Stores with Assortment Type `b` (extra) have the highest average sales (**8553.93**), while those with Assortment Type `a` (basic) show the lowest (**5481.03**).
4. **Competitor Distance:**
   - Stores closer to competitors (0-500 meters) have higher sales on average compared to those farther away, though overall correlation is weak.
5. **Sales and Customers:**
   - Strong positive correlation (**0.895**) between the number of customers and sales, indicating customer volume as a critical driver of revenue.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Python:** Data processing, analysis, and model building.
- **Libraries:**  
  - **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy.  
  - **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
  - **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (planned).  
- **Logging:** Python `logging` library for traceability.

## **Current Status**
- Completed an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights from customer purchasing behavior.
- Cleaning and feature engineering are completed, preparing for model development.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Sales Forecasting Models:**
   - Develop machine learning and deep learning models for sales prediction.
2. **Deployment:**
   - Build a web interface to serve predictions to the finance team.
3. **Further Analysis:**
   - Investigate trends by `StoreType` and assess the interaction of promotions with holidays and competition.
